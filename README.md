The Advanced Respiratory Protection System is a comprehensive solution designed to enhance respiratory care by providing real-time monitoring, interactive support, emergency response, and access to professional medical assistance. The system integrates multiple sensors and modules to track and manage respiratory health effectively.

One of the key features is the Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring, which uses external APIs to fetch live air quality index (AQI) data based on the user's location. This feature provides alerts and recommendations, such as advising users to avoid outdoor activities when air quality is poor, thus helping to prevent potential respiratory issues.

The system also includes Interactive Breathing Exercises, offering guided techniques and exercises tailored to conditions like asthma, COPD, and anxiety-induced breathlessness. These exercises are designed to help users strengthen their lung capacity, manage stress, and improve overall respiratory function.

For professional medical assistance, the system features an Online Doctor Consultation platform. This telemedicine service allows users to book and attend real-time video consultations with pulmonologists or general practitioners, ensuring they receive expert advice and support.

In addition, the system facilitates Online Medicine Ordering, enabling users to order prescription medications, inhalers, or oxygen therapy devices directly through trusted online pharmacies. This feature ensures that users have easy access to essential medications and devices.

Finally, the Quick Ambulance Call Feature provides an emergency SOS button that connects users to ambulance services or nearby hospitals in case of a severe respiratory crisis. This feature ensures that users can receive immediate assistance when needed.

By integrating these advanced features, the Advanced Respiratory Protection System offers a holistic approach to respiratory care, combining real-time environmental awareness, interactive support, emergency response, and professional medical assistance to ensure optimal respiratory health.
